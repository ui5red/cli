## Packages

UI5 CLI consists of multiple packages managed within this monorepo:

- **packages/cli**: UI5 Command Line Interface, utilizing all of the following packages
- **packages/project**: Modules for building a UI5 project's dependency tree, including configuration
- **packages/server**: Modules for running a UI5 development server
- **packages/builder**: Modules for building UI5 projects
- **packages/fs**: UI5 specific file system abstraction
- **packages/logger**: Internal logging module

## Bun Comparison Workflow

This fork is evaluated together with sibling `bun` and `ui5-cli-on-bun` checkouts.

Run the comparison from the standalone harness repository:

```sh
cd ../ui5-cli-on-bun
npm run compare:fixtures
```

Profile a specific fixture under both runtimes with:

```sh
npm run profile:fixture:node -- --only builder/application.e --repeat 3
npm run profile:fixture:bun -- --only builder/application.e --repeat 3
```

The harness resolves sibling repositories by default:

- `../bun`
- `../cli`

Override those locations with `BUN_REPO` and `UI5_CLI_REPO` if your checkouts live elsewhere.

Latest local runtime comparison (`npm run compare:fixtures`, 2026-04-15):

| Metric | Node | Bun | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Overall wall time | 30.42 s | 30.25 s | Bun faster by 0.17 s |
| Build total | 28.64 s | 28.55 s | Bun faster by 0.09 s |
| Build prepare | 9.45 s | 9.97 s | Bun slower by 0.52 s |
| Build `ui5` | 18.74 s | 18.18 s | Bun faster by 0.56 s |
| Serve | 1.07 s | 1.06 s | Bun faster by 0.01 s |
| Parity | 0.62 s | 0.55 s | Bun faster by 0.07 s |

The current fork change disables worker-backed minify and theme builds under Bun, which removed the large workerpool cleanup penalty that previously dominated Bun build time. Repeat the comparison on your own machine before treating these numbers as canonical.
